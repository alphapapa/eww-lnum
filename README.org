This is extension to the Emacs browser [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/eww][eww]] that adds to it [[http://conkeror.org][conkeror]]
like functionality[1].  More specifically, the following commands are
provided:

*eww-lnum-follow* activates numbering and visits selected link,
activates/moves to form field or pushes button.

*eww-lnum-universal* activates numbering and offers appropriate
actions for the selection.

[1] In short, currently visible links, forms, buttons are temporarily assigned
numbers with which the former can be immediately activated.  Also
filtering can be applied so selection can be incrementally confined in
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch][Isearch]] manner.
